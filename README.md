# Pokemon API project
## Version 2.00.00
This repo serves as a practice ground for my APIs and other JS techniques that I will need in the very near future.

### Things to do:
[x] Clean up html and form a structure
[x] add css and make it look more pretty(maybe have a static pokeDex image and put Data on top of it or make a dex looking object using css)
[x] Turn the initial fetch into an async function

### JS Things for functionality:
[x] Add ID search function
[] Add functionality for name as well in case of name given instead of number
[] Add a button that will switch you to the next pokemon from the one you are on.
[] When done with above feature add an auto complete function
[x] Make Background turn color to match the type of current Pokemon
[]Add pokemon abilities similar to the stats

### Things Fixed:
[x] Replaced GBA game sprites with the official artwork from the game's illustrators
[x] Right now on getting single type pokemon type info works, so it needs to work if it has either 1 or 2 types

### Things for later:
[] add Sass
[] try it out on a framework
[x] 2.0 Major Revamp
[] update readme
