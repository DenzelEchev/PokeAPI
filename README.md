This repo serves as a practice ground for my APIs and other JS techniques that I will need in the very near future.

### Work in Progress
```
Converting project to react using Vite.
TypeScript and Tailwind CSS will also be added into the project.
Clean up API calls and UI

progress: initial set-up
```

### Things to do
---
[x] Clean up html and form a structure <br>
[x] add css and make it look more pretty(maybe have a static pokeDex image and put Data on top of it or make a dex looking object using css) <br>
[x] Turn the initial fetch into an async function <br>

### JS Things for functionality
---
[x] Add ID search function <br>
[] Add functionality for name as well in case of name given instead of number <br>
[] Add a button that will switch you to the next pokemon from the one you are on. <br>
[] When done with above feature add an auto complete function <br>
[x] Make Background turn color to match the type of current Pokemon <br>
[]Add pokemon abilities similar to the stats <br>

### Things Fixed
---
[x] Replaced GBA game sprites with the official artwork from the game's illustrators <br>
[x] Right now on getting single type pokemon type info works, so it needs to work if it has either 1 or 2 types <br>dd

### Things for later
---
[x] add Sass <br>
[] add tailwind css
[x] try it out on a framework, with TypeScript <br>
[x] 2.0 Major Revamp <br>
[x] 3.0 Major Revamp <br>
[x] update readme <br>
[] clean up the UI of the app and streamline the API calls
