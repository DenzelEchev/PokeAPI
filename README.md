# PokeAPI
Pokemon API project
This repo serves as a practice ground for my APIs and other JS techniques that I will need in the very near future.

Things to do:
-Clean up html and form a structure
-add css and make it look more pretty

JS Things for functionality:
-Add ID search function(done and bug checked)
-Add function for name as well in case of name given instead of number(WIP)
-When done with above feature add an auto complete function
-
